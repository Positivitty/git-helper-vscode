# Git Helper - Learn Git Step by Step

A beginner-friendly VS Code extension that teaches Git by guiding you through each step inside your editor.

## What It Does

**Walkthrough Panel (sidebar):** A step-by-step guide that walks you through the entire Git workflow — from checking if Git is installed to pushing code to GitHub. Each step explains what the command does in plain English, shows you the exact command, and lets you run it with one click.

**Quick Actions (Command Palette):** Common Git commands available through the Command Palette for when you already know what you want to do.

## How to Run Locally (Development)

### Prerequisites

- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) installed
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed (v18 or newer)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) installed

### Step 1: Install Dependencies

Open a terminal in the project folder and run:

```bash
npm install
```

**Checkpoint:** You should see a `node_modules/` folder appear. No errors in the terminal.

### Step 2: Compile the TypeScript

```bash
npm run compile
```

**Checkpoint:** You should see an `out/` folder appear with `.js` files inside it. No errors in the terminal.

### Step 3: Open in VS Code

```bash
code .
```

This opens the project folder in VS Code.

### Step 4: Launch the Extension Development Host

1. Press **F5** (or go to Run > Start Debugging)
2. A new VS Code window will open — this is the "Extension Development Host"
3. This second window has your extension loaded and ready to test

**Checkpoint:** The new window should open without errors.

### Step 5: Open the Git Walkthrough

1. In the Extension Development Host window, look at the **Activity Bar** (the icons on the far left)
2. You should see a new Git branch icon — click it
3. The "Git Walkthrough" sidebar panel should appear with all 9 steps

**Checkpoint:** You can see the walkthrough steps with descriptions and "Run Step" buttons.

### Step 6: Test It Out

1. Open a folder in the Extension Development Host (File > Open Folder)
2. Click "Run Step" on Step 1 to verify Git is installed
3. Work through the steps in order!

### Step 7: Try the Quick Actions

1. Press **Cmd+Shift+P** (Mac) or **Ctrl+Shift+P** (Windows/Linux)
2. Type "Git Helper"
3. You should see all 5 commands listed

### How the Files Connect

```
package.json
  ↓ defines views, commands, activation
extension.ts
  ↓ registers the sidebar provider and commands
  ├── walkthroughProvider.ts  ← builds the sidebar HTML, handles button clicks
  │     ↓ imports
  │     ├── steps.ts          ← step definitions (titles, descriptions, commands)
  │     └── gitCommands.ts    ← runs git safely and logs output
  └── gitCommands.ts          ← also used directly by quick action commands
```
